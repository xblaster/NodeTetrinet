NodeTetrinet
============

NodeTetrinet is an open source implementation of a Tetrinet clone with node.js, angular.js and socket.io.

# Launch your own server

Checkout the project and type in a command line
>npm install

>node app.js

For an easier setup you can use docker

> docker run -d -p 3000:3000 xblaster/tetrinet

And it will rocks ;)

# TODO LIST

* add "special power" like in the original tetrinet to make the game more "fun"
* clean the code. Some part are quite weird
* do not set vars directly on socket
